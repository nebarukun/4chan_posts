# 4chan Posts WordPress Plugin

### WordPress plugin to add 4chan posts to your WordPress website. The plugin uses the 4chan API.

## Description

This WordPress plugin allows you to easily add 4chan posts to your pages via the Gutenberg Blocks. It uses the 4chan API to fetch the posts directly from 4chan.

Currently you can only add one 4chan post block per page, otherwise it will display the same content on all blocks that are present on the page.

I will fix this as soon as possible so that you can add as many different 4chan post blocks on one page as you want.

This plugin is still under development, so if you find any bugs, please let me know: hello@wdtools.org


## Getting Started

### How to use:

* Download or Clone the Project
* Login as admin to your WordPress website
* Go to Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin - then upload the plugin in a zip format
* Then activate the plugin
* Now you can add the plugin to the pages using the Gutenberg Blocks.
